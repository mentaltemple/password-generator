# <password-generator>

## Description

- My motivation behind this project was to deepen my understanding of JavaScript by building a functional web app.
- I built this project because it was a complex puzzle to solve and it provided a lot of learning opportunities for JavaScript.
- This project allows a user to generate a secure password incorporating lowercase, uppercase, numerical and special characters.
- I learned a ton about functions, methods, objects, arrays, variables.
- As of right now, it's not fully functional, but I learned a lot just getting to this point. I hope I can get it fully completed by the time you are reading this.
