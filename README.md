# <password-generator>

## Description

- My motivation behind this project was to deepen my understanding of JavaScript by building a functional web app.
- I built this project because it was a complex puzzle to solve and it provided a lot of learning opportunities for JavaScript.
- This project allows a user to generate a secure password incorporating their choice of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numerals and/or special characters.
- I learned a ton about functions, methods, objects, arrays, variables, for loops, if else statements, booleans, prompts, alerts, and how to randomize an array.
